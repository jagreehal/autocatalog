`autocatalog site`, `ac docs check` and the EventCatalog export find repositories anywhere under the root. Each package in a monorepo publishes its docs, contracts and consumer declarations under its folder name, with owners from the monorepo's CODEOWNERS.

Repositories can declare business processes in `flows/<id>.md`. Each flow gets a page with a step-by-step walkthrough, and you can group its steps by domain or team, as boxes or lanes. Steps can name events, services and agents from any repository, and the site flags any hop that no producer or consumer declaration backs.

The site publishes WSDL, XML Schema, XML, GraphQL, RAML and AsyncAPI files from `contracts/`, each on its own page with a download. A `<name>.autocatalog.json` sidecar attaches a specification to a service or publishes any JSON or YAML file.

Maps use `@eventcatalog/visualiser` 5.1.2.
